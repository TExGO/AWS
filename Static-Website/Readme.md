This is simple project on how to deploy a static website using the AWS S3 service.

Static Website - A static website is a site where the content is fixed and does not change dynamically. It consists of pre-built HTML files that are delivered directly to the user's browser without any server-side processing

AWS S3 - Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable, high-speed, web-based cloud storage service designed for online backup and archiving of data and applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage.

About Project -The project involves deploying a static website using Amazon S3, a cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). A static website is composed of fixed content, typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, that does not change in response to user interactions. By leveraging AWS S3, we can take advantage of its scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness to host a static website that is fast, secure, and highly available.

Project Goals - Create an S3 bucket to store your website files.

                Configure the S3 bucket to host a static website.
                
                Upload your website files to the S3 bucket.
                
                Set the appropriate permissions to make the website publicly accessible.
                
                Enable static website hosting and test the deployment.
