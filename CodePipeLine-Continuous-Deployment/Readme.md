This is a project helps you to understand the working the AWS CodePipeLine service with the help of AWS S3.

AWS CodePipeLine - AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that automates the build, test, and deployment phases of your release process. It allows you to create pipelines that automatically build, test, and deploy your code every time there is a code change, based on the workflow you define.

AWS S3 - Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable, high-speed, web-based cloud storage service designed for online backup and archiving of data and applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage.

About Project - The projects first involves creating a AWS S3 bucket to serve as a static website. Next we create the pipeline using the AWS CodePipeLine service. We see all the configurations involved in all the stages of creating a pipeline. In this we connect our GitHub account with the AWS and with the help of pipeline we achieve the deployement on the S3 bucket.
